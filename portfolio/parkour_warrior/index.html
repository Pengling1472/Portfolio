                This project is not our idea and it is from MCCâ€™s Parkour Warrior, we did this for entertainment purposes. The project was done by a team of two. The programming language we use is JavaScript, I wrote scripts for checkpoints, which each of them gave the player an item and their scores. I created an entity that displays the player scores and the leaderboard by the end of the game and made some custom blocks for the map. I also programmed the team's functionality and used the Minecraft Server UI module to set up the UI for team selection and game settings. Programmed the timer and countdown for the game.
