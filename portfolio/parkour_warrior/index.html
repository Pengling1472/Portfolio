                This project is inspired by MCCâ€™s Parkour Warrior and was created purely for entertainment purposes. The project was done by a team of two. We used JavaScript as our programming language, I wrote scripts for  the checkpoints, which gave the players an item and their scores. I created an entity that displays the player scores and a leaderboard at the end of the game, along with some custom blocks for the map. Additionally, I programmed the team functionality and used the Minecraft Server UI module to set up the UI for team selection and game settings. I also programmed the timer and countdown for the game.
